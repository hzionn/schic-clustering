# Introduction

To cluster single-cell Hi-C data, often require heavy works on feature extraction and imputation.
And clustering is just a downstream task performed on the embeddings generated by these methods.

There still are previous approaches like k-nn Minhash and LDA are more direct in their clustering focus.

todo:

# Why clustering scHi-C data?

# Challenges for analysis based on scHi-C data
